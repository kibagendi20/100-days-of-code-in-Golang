# 100 Days Of Code in Go - Log

### Day 0: March 30, 2023 

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Go on defining variables,constants and also learnt data types. Built a program to print variable values to illustrate various methods of defining variables, constants.

**Thoughts:** I lost psyche that I has when starting until now I still feel I overwhelmed since I did not accomplish the task that I intended to do.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.
